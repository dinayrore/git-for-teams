# Git 4 Teams!

This repo will be used for Code The Dream students to explore the functionality of Git from within a team setting.

## Common Git Commands:
- git status
  * checks for file commits by verifying file status

- git add
  * adds files noted after the add command
  * if you use a . after the add command this command will add all untracked files to your local Git

- git commit -m
  * every file added to git must have a commit message added to it so that git knows where this file is coming from
  * your message should be short, but also specific enough for you to pick up were you last left off

- git push
  * git push takes all local git commits and pushes them up to a remote repository previously designated through your Github repo setup

- git branch
  * creates a new branch to work on code in isolation

- git checkout
  * switch to another branch on your local machine

- git pull
  * pulls code from remote repository
  
- git stash
  * hides your local changes temporarily for a git pull
  
- git stash apply
  * restores stashed changes
  
- git stash drop
  * removes stashed changes
  
- git diff
  * allows the user to view the differences between two versions of the same file of code
